# Building a Typing Game with React! 

This project is a simple typing game built with React. I built this to get some practice with React, explore and learn more about string manipulation, and refresh my memory of DOM mechanics. A user is given a word from a pre-made list of words, the goal is to type the most words correctly in a time limit. 


### Note on this Repository:

This directory is a brief example of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

#### Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own React project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

#### How We Created This Example

To get started with React, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with Vercel, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```
