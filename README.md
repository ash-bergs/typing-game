# Building a Typing Game with React! 

This project is a simple typing game built with React. I built this to get some practice with React, project file structure, string manipulation, and refresh my memory of DOM mechanics. A user is given a word from a pre-made list of words, the goal is to type the most words correctly in a time limit. 

This was built using a tutorial, once built I will refactor it and make it my own. There's nothing wrong with learning from our betters! üì∫üè´


### Note on this Repository:

This directory is a brief example of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

#### Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own React project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/create-react-app-functions)

_Live Example: https://create-react-app.now-examples.now.sh/_

#### How We Created This Example

To get started with React, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with Vercel, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

### Future Versions: 

- Easy, Intermediate, Expert levels - generate different lists of words based on included letters, words with x's, p's, q's for example could be in the algorithm for "expert mode" for example, or longer length words 

Preliminary research:
