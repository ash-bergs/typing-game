# Building a Typing Game with React! 

[Play Here!](https://typing-game-beta-one.vercel.app/)

This project is a simple typing game built with React. I built this to get some practice with React, project file structure, string manipulation, and refresh my memory of DOM mechanics. A user is given a word from a pre-made list of words, the goal is to type the most words correctly in a time limit. 

This was built using a tutorial, once built I will refactor it and make it my own. There's nothing wrong with learning from our betters! üì∫üè´

# Version One: 

In the first version of this app, following a Udemy tutorial, we built the basics. 

5 Components: 

- App 

- Container 

- Button 

- Results 

- Typeracer 

Styles have also been added, that included responsive flow achieved quite eloquently.

# Version Two: 

The tutorial was quite short, and just completed the bare minimum. I've been working to bring more functionality to the app, hopefully making it a little more interactive. 

For starters I changed the color scheme just a bit. The coral red was a little harsh in my opinion. Furthermore, using the same color for both correct and incorrect words in the Results component was confusing. I replaced this color with seagreen, and retained it for the incorrect words visualized in Results.

You'll also notice that the score (at the very top of the right-hand side of the screen) now shows both the user's current score (number of correctly typed words) against the *total* number of attempts. I think this gave the user a nice bit of information they might find interesting. 


### Note on this Repository:

This directory is a brief example of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

#### Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own React project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/create-react-app-functions)

_Live Example: https://create-react-app.now-examples.now.sh/_

#### How We Created This Example

To get started with React, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with Vercel, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```

### Future Versions: 

- Easy, Intermediate, Expert levels - generate different lists of words based on included letters, words with x's, p's, q's for example could be in the algorithm for "expert mode" for example, or longer length words
